    <h1>Examining the Studies</h1>
</div>


<div id="explain">
    <p class="explainP">For Gratitude on the Brain, four primary studies were used in tandem to better understand how
        gratitude works in the brain. All four studies utilized fMRIs, and either gratitude journaling or scenarios to
        illuminate regions of interest (ROIs). Here I will break down each study to better understand what these ROIs
        mean within the context of the study.</p>
</div>


<div class="study1">
    <h2 class="study1title"> Study 1: Neural Correlates of Gratitude</h2>
    <img id='study1img' src="images/study1.png" alt="Brain image of vmPFC and Nucleus Accumbens">
    <div id="subStudy1">
        <p id="study1para">Study 1 was performed over the course of three weeks with both a gratitude journal group
            and
            an active-neutral journal control group. Both groups were given fMRIs to determine which ROIs, if any, were
            affected by the practice of gratitude and their journaling efforts. Results from the study showed there to
            be an
            increase in the neural pure altruism response in the Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC), as well as a
            response in the Nucleus Accumbens. These researchers were particularly interested in the relationship
            between
            gratitude and pure altruism, so their studies also focused on the extent to which this was the case. They
            found
            that levels of gratitude corresponded with neural pure altruism, and that gratitude biases the brain’s
            reward
            system toward rewards for others versus oneself (Fox et al., 2015). The vmPFC, the part of the brain that is
            associated with risk, fear, morality and decision making, resulted in increased neural measures of pure
            altruism
            after just three weeks of gratitude journaling, when compared to control group. In short, the study showed
            that
            practicing gratitude not only leaves us feeling better, but leads to more altruistic ventures, or a genuine
            interest and concern for others unrelated to oneself.</p>

<div class="study2">
    <h2 class="study2Title">Study 2: The Effects of Gratitude Expression on Neural Activity</h2>
    <img id='study2img' src="images/study2.png" alt="Brain image of vmPFC and ACC">
    <div id="subStudy2">
        <p id="study2para">
            Working with subjects with depression and/or anxiety, study 2 used gratitude letter writing for three
            months,
            compared with a neutral letter writing group. After three months, they performed fMRI scans to compare
            gratitude
            in the brain. Results from the study showed greater and longer lasting neural sensitivity to gratitude,
            which,
            like study 1, also presented in the vmPFC. Researchers hypothesized that other ROIs should include the
            limbic
            system: anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC), the Anterior Insula, and the striatum, since these are associated
            with
            affect. Their studies were consistent with this thought, and activity was noted in the ACC, as well as the
            vmPFC, and Anterior Insula. Most interestingly though, the researchers saw lasting effects in the ACC in
            response to the gratitude journaling and suggest that this may suggest a neural plasticity effect. This is
            the
            idea that we can change our neurons in response to a stimulus, in this case, gratitude. The sagittal view,
            above, shows the vmPFC as well as the ACC. Not shown are the Anterior Insula, and the striatum, which also
            were
            shown as ROIs in this study.

<div class="study3">
    <h2 class="study3Title">Study 3: Neural Substrates and Social Consequences of Interpersonal
        Gratitude: Intention Matters</h2>
    <img id='study3img' src="images/study3.png" alt="Brain image with multiple ROIs">
    <div id="subStudy3">
        <p id="study3para">Researchers in study 3 hypothesized that gratitude would be associated with regions in the
            brain known to be used in moral cognition, value judgement and theory of mind. Simulating an experience in
            which the participants would either receive or not receive help from others, they measured, again, with an
            fMRI scan, gratitude in the brain. Their findings supported this hypothesis, showing brain activity in the
            ACC, vmPFC, and Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC). Moreover, after asking participants to reflect on the
            others’ choices to either help or not help each other, researchers noted activity in the thalamus, among
            other parts. Deactivated regions included the ACC and the PCC. They summarized that the feeling of
            gratitude, as a response to another person doing something for your benefit, may not only feel good, but
            also reduce pain, improve relationships and enhance the idea of paying it forward, suggesting that our
            cultural expectation to say thank you, or be grateful for what you have, may have bigger impact on our lives
            than simply being kind. </p>
