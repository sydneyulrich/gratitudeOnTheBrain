        I began this research with my own 30 day collection and consumption blog, reflecting on what I had collected and consumed daily. I frequently collected moments and emotions, in particular gratitude. From simply being grateful for my dog, to gratitude for my curiosity, I explored the things that invoked emotion in my life. Employing my curiosity I wondered, what does emotion look like in my brain? What is happening?

        Moreover, in our society, we are frequently told to be grateful for what we have, to say the magic words “thank you,” or to count our blessings. We’re conditioned to experience and demonstrate gratitude from childhood, because gratefulness is kind. Our culture operates on gratitude. Thanksgiving is a prime example of this. Considering both my own reflections through the blog, and examining the way society approaches gratitude, Gratitude on the Brain was born.

        In sifting through research, I found studies on the neural involvement of gratitude to be few and far between. What I could find felt dense, and unapproachable as a non-researcher. This website acts as a simplified visual representation of the brain and specific regions of interest which have been used in experiencing gratitude. The second half of the home page scroll reflects some of the things I am personally grateful for, some from my 30 day blog. Through gratitude journaling in particular, studies show the possibility of neural plasticity, the changing of neurons’ functions in response to stimulation or alterations (in this case, repeated gratitude), rendering a person more grateful and altruistic.
